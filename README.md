- 👋 Hey all, @StraviosRex here!
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning practices and AI in general, especially behavioral AI in games and recently surging Gen. AI products and tools. In addition, I am also interested in web development, especially when testing out new frameworks.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in Python in general, along with Machine Learning frameworks/libraries. Additionally, focused on training and employing AI agents for the sake of learning!
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating or lending a hand to other projects in general.
